# upaes (University Project Approval & Evaluation System) 
### Abu Zahid Md Jalal Uddin Joy
University Project Approval &amp; Evaluation System (UPAES) is developed to evaluate the University Final year/semester wise projects and automate the approval system to raise the online activity in a smart way. It will reduce the complexity of physical effort for meeting with the head/supervisors in educational institutions. It's developed for improving work hour also.

## 1 INTRODUCTION
### Project Overview

The software & hardware project title & view of the project/document will be sent to the
system/web application by the students for approving & the authority/admin will accept the project
of that institutions and allows the student to proceed and start working on the Project. If authority
reject the project, student should have to reform his/her concept or documents! The
review/comments system will be shown.
In the middle of the Project designing, the authority/admin also makes a request to the Student to
send the Sample Document/Code of any module as well. The student has to prepare the necessary
document like Project Final document with Modules, User roles, SDLC methodologies, UML
diagrams, PowerPoint presentation file, Project Flow diagram, Database designs etc. with the soft
copy. The authority/admin will review the project with documents & will select the supervisor for
the project.

After that the Supervisor will review the concept/project, the authority/admin/supervisor can
download the Project content from the University Student portal/system/website (from the Internet)
and can do the evaluation.
As well, the Student can also download the content from the University student portal/website and
give Demo of the Project.

### 1.2 Project Purpose
To evaluate the University Final year/semester wise projects and automate the approval system to
raise the online activity in a smart way.

### 1.2.1 Background
University/academic project management is a major issue during the evaluation period of
semester which is being faced by many educational institutions. The main reason for this is
there is no automated system followed in any institute. University management/staff gathers all
the project reports and project sources from students and store them physically in some
locations probably libraries/store room. To overcome this practical problem and also to make
the process easy I’ll develop a secured web application which is useful for each.

### 1.2.2 Goals

In this Online Project Approval System project, I’ll will focus mainly on automating the
process of project submission. In the sense project topics will be submitted online along with
*.doc/*.pdf and approval will be provided online by the head of the department along with
suggestions if any. This will reduce the physical efforts of students meeting the head of the
project/department and also reduce the time frame period of completing this part of project
work.

Students can also update their project status weekly and provide in for regarding the progress,
which will be monitored by all relevant supervisors/professors and head of departments.
